Additionally to the tests provided by `make check`, upstream provides a script
`uml-test` for additional tests, related to GRUB integration. This script
setups a virtual environment, and requires the following dependencies:
grub-common, slirp, squashfs-tools and user-mode-linux.

As part of the package build, we only run `make check`.
